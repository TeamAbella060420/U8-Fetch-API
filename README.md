# U8-Fetch-API

1. Write a Basic Fetch Request - writing a basic fetch request using the global fetch() method. Then we'll use JavaScript promises to handle the results returned from the server.
2. Displaying the Content - we'll display the image on the page, and fetch the list of breeds to display the <select> menu options.
3. Create a Reusable Fetch Function - simplify your fetch requests by creating a reusable data-fetching function that runs the fetch, returns the response in JSON, and more.
