# U8-Fetch-API

1. Write a Basic Fetch Request - writing a basic fetch request using the global fetch() method. Then we'll use JavaScript promises to handle the results returned from the server.
2. Displaying the Content - we'll display the image on the page, and fetch the list of breeds to display the <select> menu options.
3. Create a Reusable Fetch Function - simplify your fetch requests by creating a reusable data-fetching function that runs the fetch, returns the response in JSON, and more. 
4. Handling Errors - What would happen if a fetch gets rejected or returns in a failed state? To handle these types of errors, you use the catch() method, which deals with rejected cases only.
5. Manage Multiple Requests with Promise.all - JavaScript promises provide an easier, more efficient way to fire off and keep track of multiple async operations at the same time with Promise.all. In this video, you'll learn how to manage multiple fetch requests with promise.all.
6. Posting Data with fetch() - The default HTTP method for making fetch requests is GET, which retrieves data from a server. You can make requests other than GET (like POST, DELETE and PUT) by passing additional information to fetch().
